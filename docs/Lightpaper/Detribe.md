The building blocks of deTrbie are the tribe and follows. They will be familiar to everyone who has used any social media platform.

The best way to understand them is through comparison to familiar platforms:

**Detribes** are similar to:

- Telegram groups
- Discord servers
- Channels on YouTube

### User-ownerd social network

On current social networks we have very limited input on how the platform is governed partly because we have no ownership of the platform. The biggest social media companies make billions of dollars but donâ€™t share the profits with the users and only some fraction with the content creators. Even as shareholders of the parent company, we are likely to have little input.

On Detribes, users are the owners of the network. Token holders can participate in the overall governance of the Detribes platform, but users can also participate in the governance of each tribe where they are a member. Each tribe is like a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where members can have ownership and help to steer the way that a space is governed. Space governance is, of course, optional but we believe many tribes will choose to adopt this feature.
