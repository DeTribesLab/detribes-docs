deTrbies is an open platform that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized censorship-resistant social networks and marketplaces. deTrbies will help you create your own decentralized version of the popular circle we see today, such as Discord, Telegram and more.

Our software is built on the EVM blockchain framework and uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage. This enables personalized chat and notifications, a transparent reputation system, full text searching, and rich content formats, all without sacrificing SEO (search engine optimization).

Using EVM also allows deTribes to connect to the Ethereum, Biance smartchain and Polygon networks. deTribes will launch more chains in coming months.

deTribes is social media unbounded.
