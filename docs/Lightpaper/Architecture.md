Detribes is more than a circle management platform with crypto payments. It is a revolution in connecting social media with decentralized finance. This is social finance where social media meets DeFi. To better explain how we differ from a simple circle management platform we must outline our architecture at a high level.

We will briefly cover topics such as where content is published and how it can be monetized via a myriad of primitives that we are working on adding as soon as possible. This paper will also cover how we handle reputation and allow for a multitude of reputation types.

Detribes saves you the hassle of running your own social network blockchain. Multiple social networks can run from the Detribes protocals which will provide shared networking effects. By default the network is censorship-resistant, however, each community is able to set their own rules for moderation.
