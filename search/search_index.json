There are always costs, so value has to be extracted somehow. Your data, time and attention are your payments. Had we known then what we know now, we may have chosen differently. It is also important to acknowledge that while value was extracted by social media platforms of Web 2.0, the bigger story is actually a more positive one. Individuals could create content, share it with the world, and get paid without leaving their homes. Despite this freedom which we have to express ourselves and get paid for the value we create, we also know that the Internet is not as free as intended. Accessing the web, posting content, and receiving payment involves numerous service providers lurking in the background. These service providers can block your content, halt your payments, or simply remove you from the platform entirely. Every service provider is a potential point of censorship, and they all extract value from you. Blockchain is a technology for disintermediation. It is possible to remove the unnecessary service providers that stand between creators and consumers. We see an interesting paradox where blockchain technology is most valuable when it extracts as little value as possible from its users. Facebook shouldn\u2019t sell your data without paying you. YouTube shouldn\u2019t get paid more for advertising than you do. Twitter shouldn\u2019t be able to ban you or block your tweets because they disagree with you. This is why we have created Detrbies. A web 3.0 technology with the promise of data sovereignty. You control the data you create. Your content, your value.","title":"Home"},{"location":"UserGuide/","text":"User Guide Anyone can create a Detribe on chain and link it to his/her Discord server.

It is a revolution in connecting social media with decentralized finance. This is social finance where social media meets DeFi. To better explain how we differ from a simple circle management platform we must outline our architecture at a high level. We will briefly cover topics such as where content is published and how it can be monetized via a myriad of primitives that we are working on adding as soon as possible. This paper will also cover how we handle reputation and allow for a multitude of reputation types. Detribes saves you the hassle of running your own social network blockchain. Multiple social networks can run from the Detribes protocals which will provide shared networking effects. By default the network is censorship-resistant, however, each community is able to set their own rules for moderation.","title":"Architecutre"},{"location":"Lightpaper/Detribe/","text":"The building blocks of deTrbie are the tribe and follows. They will be familiar to everyone who has used any social media platform. The best way to understand them is through comparison to familiar platforms: Detribes are similar to: Telegram groups Discord servers Channels on YouTube User-ownerd social network On current social networks we have very limited input on how the platform is governed partly because we have no ownership of the platform. The biggest social media companies make billions of dollars but don\u2019t share the profits with the users and only some fraction with the content creators. Even as shareholders of the parent company, we are likely to have little input. On Detribes, users are the owners of the network. Token holders can participate in the overall governance of the Detribes platform, but users can also participate in the governance of each tribe where they are a member. Each tribe is like a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where members can have ownership and help to steer the way that a space is governed. Space governance is, of course, optional but we believe many tribes will choose to adopt this feature.","title":"Detribe"},{"location":"Lightpaper/Detribe/#user-ownerd-social-network","text":"On current social networks we have very limited input on how the platform is governed partly because we have no ownership of the platform.

Detrbies will help you create your own decentralized version of the popular circle we see today, such as Discord, Telegram and more. Our software is built on the EVM blockchain framework and uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage. This enables personalized chat and notifications, a transparent reputation system, full text searching, and rich content formats, all without sacrificing SEO (search engine optimization). Using EVM also allows Detribes to connect to the Ethereum, Biance smartchain and Polygon networks. Detribes will launch more chains in coming months. Detribes is social media unbounded.","title":"Overview"}]}
